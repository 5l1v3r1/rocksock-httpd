ROCKSOCK-HTTPD
==============

... possibly worlds smallest and most bug-free httpd ...

recommended to use with musl libc, statically linked

pros
----

+ requires only ~200 KB stack memory, and one chunk of heap memory (maybe 1KB) for the command line options parser.
+ statically linked binary is only ~40 KB (with musl libc)
+ max throughput is ~75MB/s, can be adjusted via buffersize (in sourcecode) for even lower memory usage
+ using asynchronous sockets via select()
+ uses only one thread (useful for i.e. a VPS that is limited by number of processes)
+ cpu usage is 0.0 when idle and around 10% on full throttle on a 2 ghz machine.
+ source code is only ~600 LOC + ~400 lines of library code
+ uses filesystem for "paging", thus removing the need for error-prone memory handling.
  this also allows it to run on a *very* limited embedded platform, which has barely enough ram for the kernel.
  of course it is recommended to use tempfs for that paging zone.
+ easy scripting interface. if a known script extension is encountered, the script will be started and 3 filenames 
  passed to it. the first file contains the entire request received from the client, the 2nd is for the response, 
  the 3rd for additional information, such as IP address.
+ comes with perl scripting interface. could easily be ported to other scripting langs...
+ keep-alive is supported and can be controlled with a command line argument
+ designed with security in mind
+ no config file needed

cons
----
- max parallel clients 1024 (limited by FD_SET_SIZE)
- does NOT support a whole lot of all the fancy HTTP features, which were invented for blackhat usage. 
  instead it supports only the subset needed for webbrowsing (GET/POST).
- does NOT support url-encoded urls at the filename level, i.e. hello%20world.html would become a 404,
  but the other GET params can be decoded using a script. as a consequence, only ASCII filenames will work.
- since the httpd is limited to 1024 connections, a DOS attack needs only little attacker ressources.
  if you have many enemies, you should probably use another httpd for your public website.
- lengthy script execution will block other parallel connections.


NOTICE
------
it is recommended to pass a directory with tempfs as working directory to the executable.
